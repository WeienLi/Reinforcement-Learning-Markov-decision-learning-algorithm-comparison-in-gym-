# Reinforcement-Learning-Markov-decision-learning-algorithm-comparison-in-gymnasium-Enviroment
This expriment could be split to two parts in the first part we implemented and compare the vanilla SARSA and expected SARSA markov learning algorithms 
with boltzmann exploration algorithm comparing them in the "FrozenLake-v1" enviroment in gymnasium. As explained in the notebook we picked 9 
hyperparameter pairings. 3 different learning(alpha) rate with 3 diffferent temprature. As for the second expriment, we implemented and compare the vanilla 
Q-learning algorithm with the vanilla actor-critic algorithm. Where the q-learning take advantage of the epsilon greedy exploration algorithm while the 
actor-crtic uses the boltzmann exploration algorithm. As for this expriment we picked 3 different learning rates (alpha) for both algorithm and 3 different
epsilon for the q-learning while fixing the temprature of the actor-crtic to 2.
